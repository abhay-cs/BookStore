# This Repository is the part of the group project from one of the courses i took at my university. This project was designed and delveloped with a team of 4 others.



# Book Ordering System
The **Book Ordering System(BOS)** will allow users to buy, sell or rent books through the app. Users will also be able to browse and find books based on their preference. In addition, the app will allow users to have an account, track transaction records and allow debit/credit card payments. Accounts created by users can either be as buyers or sellers. The primary goal of the app is to make books more accessible and cheaper for people to use.

Buyers will be able to search for a book by typing the **name**, unique **ISBN number** or even the **genre** among others. A short summary of the book along with details about the condition of the book, the author, the year they were published and general information will also be made available for the user to read before making a decision. Users can also **sell any books they own**. They are able to set their own prices and will have to provide the required information regarding the book which includes the name, condition and summary of the book.

A rating system will also be included in the system where any user can leave a rating or review of the book. A user’s rating who has a **verified purchase** will affect the overall rating of the book more. **This rating will be used to rank the books for customers**. The ranking of the book in the system will be set on several factors which take into account the **books’ popularity, the users’ preferences and the number of positive ratings the book gets**.

**Different access levels** will be needed for different users, for example, buyers will not be allowed to change information regarding a book’s summary. A seller will not be able to leave a rating on a book they are selling. The system will allow buyers to know the prices of their favorite books and get informed when there are price changes with the help of a **price tracker**.

A **follow-up email** will also be sent to the customers after their purchase, asking them to leave a rating on their recent transaction which will help to create a better customer experience. The system will be **free to download on the Google Play Store** and anyone is able to download and install the application. Customers will not have to go to the library to find a book but it will be delivered to them as well as read it on the any device where the app is installed if it is made available by the seller.

The project will be considered successful based on three criteria, first, it gets **increasing downloads over the course of several months**. Second, we are aiming for a **4 star rating for our application when we launch and then our ratings must not fall for consecutive periods**. Lastly, we are aiming to **sell at least 10,000 books on our application** which will make our application a top choice among enthusiasts. If all the criteria meet, our project will be considered **successful**.
