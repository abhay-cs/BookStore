Interaction 2 Worksheet
=======================

Paying off technical debt
-------------------------

One instance of us paying off technical debt is us creating a working database because in our last iteration we had a fake database to do our testing but as we said in iteration one we were going to create the real database in the next iteration.

I believe the type of debt we have taken upon ourselves is inadvertent and prudent technical debt because we spent a lot of time trying different ways of creating our database and found the way we did it works the best for us in our current situation even though it cost us a lot of time.

Another instance of us paying off technical debt is our new homepage, we are paying off this debt by actually having a homepage now after signing into your account.

The type of debt is deliberately prudent because on our first iteration we didn’t have time to create a homepage after signing in so we just had a white screen that just said login successful. We didn’t want to push a homepage that was unfinished so we talked about it and chose to just cover it up and just have the project pass the test up till that point then deal with it in iteration 2.

Retrospective
-------------

Retrospective has helped us become more open about ourselves such as not being afraid to speak up and ask questions when you are stuck and really don’t know how to move forward with a problem we’re having. We have even interacted a lot more in individual group calls and even set up one on one talks when needed now. In addition to that it has directly changed our estimated times/timelines on issues because since people are more open about problems they have we can push them to another iteration if needed instead of being left in the dark and then showing up with a lot of incomplete work at the last minute.

An example of us sharing our code and having one of our members upload for us.

Design pattern
--------------

The design pattern that fits for our project is the “singleton” pattern.

Iteration 1 Feedback fixes
---------------------------

Since no issue was opened up by the marker or other team we will use an issue the marker emailed us personally. One issue was the marker not being able to compile our project into an app for their android 9 device. There was also a weird issue where android studio (Bumblebee) wasn’t giving them an option to build the project. The fix ended up being that the marker opened up the project wrong at first and then we had to add 1 line of code in the config file for the emulator.
