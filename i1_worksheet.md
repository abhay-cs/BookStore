Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------


The login/signup feature was simple and easy to implement and it went as planned without any issues in the planning part apart from some of the android studio bugs. There is a main starting page in which there are two buttons, one for login and second for the signup and users can select what they want to do. Then login goes to a simple login activity in which users can log in with their email id and password. And then there is a signup button which opens a signup activity in which the user can sign up using first last name, email, password.

At the time of this writing one of the bugs is discovered in the signup button and is not fixed yet. It’s a null point exception error for the activity.

This feature was pushed through the main branch as the app started with this feature.


Exceptional code
----------------
Link - 

The test is conducted in 4 parts. Two objects - Users and Books are created and they are stored in the Database which is a 2d Arraylist. We use assert to check adding, deleting and viewing objects in the database. The database itself can be increased in size and so test 4 checks for that.

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Agile Planning
--------------

During our iteration 1 we realized that we underestimated the time we had for our project, and soon noticed that working together on the code would not be as smooth as we thought. We did end up pushing one of the features to iteration 2 but completed the rough draft of our code for the user sign in/account creation of our book ordering system. One of the features was signing in onto the app because after all the parts were put together the gui would crash sometimes. Based on our experience with iteration 1 we might make some changes while working on iteration 2 now, such as pushing some more complicated features back so we have more time.

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.
